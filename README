##Design
Using Django Web Framework, we developed a full-stack application requiring a database backend. You can view our preliminary object relational mapping diagram below.

Additionally, we agreed that it was a high priority to maintain consistent branding throughout the application and developed a style guide, featured below.

##Implementation
The implementation of our project over a span of 48 hours required lots of pair programming, careful source control, and collaboration. Our team used the following technologies to develop our product:
- Python
- Django Web Framework
- AWS EC2
- HTML / CSS
- SQLite3
- Git
- Confluence
- Adobe Illustrator

##Future Scope
In future iterations of this product, we would like to perform stress testing and refiine the backend and include Outlook / SlackBot integrations to further integrate wellness practices into employees' daily routines.
