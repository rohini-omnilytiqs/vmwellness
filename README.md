## Problem Statement
When the time came for VMware's annual Intern Borathon, our team assembled from a diverse range of business units, locations, and majors. We bonded over our shared interest in developing a high-impact product to improve the employee experience, and decided to develop a Wellness Platform as a technology response to COVID-19.

## Design
Using Django Web Framework, we developed a full-stack application requiring a database backend. You can view our preliminary object relational mapping diagram below.

Additionally, we agreed that it was a high priority to maintain consistent branding throughout the application and developed a style guide, featured below.

## Implementation
The implementation of our project over a span of 48 hours required lots of pair programming, careful source control, and collaboration. Our team used the following technologies to develop our product:
- Python
- Django Web Framework
- AWS EC2
- HTML / CSS
- SQLite3
- Git
- Confluence
- Adobe Illustrator

## Future Scope
In future iterations of this product, we would like to:
- perform stress testing and refiine the backend
- include Outlook / SlackBot integrations to further encourage wellness in employees' daily lives
